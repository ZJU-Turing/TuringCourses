1.\\
(a) Find the next larger permutation in lexicographic order after $76154238$. (5\%)\\
(b) Find the next larger 5-combinations of the set $\{1, \enspace 2, \enspace 3, \enspace 4, \enspace 5, \enspace 6, \enspace 7, \enspace 8\}$ after 
$\{3, \enspace 4, \enspace 5, \enspace 7, \enspace 8\}$. (5\%)

2. Allowing repeated characters, how many strings of six characters from \{`$0$' \~{} `$9$'\}: (24\%)\\
(a) contain `$1$'?\\
(b) contain exactly one `$1$'?\\
(c) contain `$1$' and `$2$' , where `$1$' is somewhere to the left of `$2$' in the string?\\
(d) contain `$1$' and `$2$' , where `$1$' is somewhere to the left of `$2$' in the string, with all the characters distinct?\\
(e) begin and end with the same character?\\
(f) consists of exactly $3$ different characters?

3. Find the coefficient of $x^{9}$ in the expansion of $(x/2 - 3/x)^{15}$. (6\%)

4. How many relations are there on a set with $n$ elements that are: (24\%)\\
(a) both reflexive and symmetric?\\
(b) both symmetric and antisymmetric?\\
(c) neither reflexive nor irreflexive?\\
(d) transitive? (if $n=2$)\\
(e) equivalence relation? (if $n=4$)\\
(f) partial order relation? (if $n=2$)\\
(\textbf{Tips}: A relation $R$ on the set $A$ is \textbf{irreflexive} if for every $a \in A, \enspace (a,a) \notin R.$)

5. Write the first $6$ terms of the sequence determined by the generating function: $(1 + x)/(1 - x)$. (10\%)

6. Find the solution to the following iteration relation: (16\%)\\
\[a_{n} = 5a_{n-1} - 6a_{n-2} + 2^{n} + 3 \enspace \textit{for} \enspace n \geq 2 \enspace \textit{where} \enspace a_{0} = 1, \enspace a_{1} = 1.\]

7. Let $A$ be a set consisting 10 integers $10 \leq a_{i} \leq 99$ that are different from each other. Prove that $A$ must have two different subsets without 
common elements, and the sums of the elements in these two subsets are equal. (10\%)
